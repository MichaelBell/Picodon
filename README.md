# Mastodon Avatar Display <!-- omit in toc -->

The intention of this project is to display the avatar of the last tooter
in your home timeline on a round LCD.  It doesn't do that yet.

It's currently a bit of a random collection of stuff, but both the display and HTTPS are functioning.

The [TLS client](https://github.com/peterharperuk/pico-examples/tree/add_mbedtls_example/pico_w/tls_client) is based on the example in Peter Harper's branch of pico-examples.

You need to be on the develop branch of the pico-sdk to get pico-mbedtls.
